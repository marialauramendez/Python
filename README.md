# Adventure Game
This is a project to create a simple text-based adventure game. The game presents the player with scenarios and asks them to make a choice between two options, which are entered as 1 or 2. The game will then provide a response based on the player's choice.
Getting Started

To get started with the text-based adventure game, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/marialauramendez/Python.git

    Open the index.html file in your web browser.

    Play the game multiple times and record what happens each time you make a certain choice in a notepad.

Building the Game

To build the text-based adventure game, you can modify the game.js file. This file contains the logic for the scenarios presented to the player and the responses based on their choices.

You can also modify the CSS styles in the styles.css file to customize the appearance of the game.
